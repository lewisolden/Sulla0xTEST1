      0: "Direct Bitcoin purchases on unregulated exchanges",
      1: "Bitcoin ETFs through regulated brokers",
      2: "Trading Bitcoin with leverage",
      3: "Lending Bitcoin on DeFi platforms"
    },
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Bitcoin ETFs through regulated brokers are considered the lowest risk option as they provide exposure to Bitcoin through familiar, regulated investment structures without the need to manage private keys or deal with cryptocurrency exchanges directly."
  },
  {
    id: "q2",
    question: "What is a key characteristic that makes Bitcoin valuable as a store of value?",
    options: {
      0: "Unlimited supply potential",
      1: "Government backing",
      2: "Fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins",
      3: "Central bank control"
    },
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Bitcoin's fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins is a key characteristic that makes it valuable as a store of value, similar to precious metals, as it ensures scarcity and prevents artificial inflation."
  },
  {
    id: "q3",
    question: "How does Metcalfe's Law apply to Bitcoin's network value?",

      0: "The value is proportional to the square of connected users",

      2: "The value is fixed regardless of users",
      3: "The value is determined by mining difficulty"
    },
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "According to Metcalfe's Law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. This applies to Bitcoin, where increased adoption leads to exponentially greater utility and network value."
  },
  {
    id: "q4",
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a recommended risk mitigation strategy for Bitcoin investment?",
    options: {
      0: "Using regulated exchanges",

      3: "Implementing strong security measures"
    },
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Investing with borrowed money is explicitly warned against in risk mitigation strategies. It's important to only invest what you can afford to lose and avoid using borrowed funds, which can lead to significant financial risks."
  },
  {
    id: "q5",
    question: "What is the primary advantage of Bitcoin ETFs for traditional investors?",
    options: {
      0: "Complete anonymity in transactions",

      2: "Higher potential returns",
      3: "Familiar investment structure through regular brokerage accounts"
