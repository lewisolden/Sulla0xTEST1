    question: "Which of the following is NOT a recommended security practice for cryptocurrency?",
    options: [
      "Writing down your private key on paper",
      "Using the same password across multiple exchanges",
      "Enabling two-factor authentication",
      "Using a hardware wallet for large amounts"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Using the same password across multiple platforms is a significant security risk. If one account is compromised, all others become vulnerable. Always use unique, strong passwords for each service."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a 'cold wallet' in cryptocurrency?",
    options: [
      "A wallet that's always connected to the internet",
      "A wallet stored offline and not connected to the internet",
      "A wallet that's been inactive for a long time",
      "A wallet with a frozen balance"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A cold wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that's stored offline and not connected to the internet, providing enhanced security against online threats and hackers."
  },

    question: "What should you do before sending a large amount of cryptocurrency?",
    options: [
      "Send the full amount immediately",
      "Send a test transaction with a small amount first",
      "Share your private key with the recipient",
      "Disable two-factor authentication temporarily"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Always send a small test transaction first to verify the correct recipient address and ensure everything works as expected before sending larger amounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is a sign of a potential cryptocurrency scam?",
    options: [
      "Promises of guaranteed returns",
      "Open-source code",
      "Detailed whitepaper",
      "Active developer community"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Promises of guaranteed returns are a major red flag in cryptocurrency investments. Legitimate projects acknowledge the risks and volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets."

    question: "What is the best way to store your recovery phrase?",
    options: [
      "In a password manager",
      "In an email draft",
      "In multiple secure physical locations",
      "On your smartphone"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Storing your recovery phrase in multiple secure physical locations (like a safe) provides redundancy while keeping it offline and safe from digital threats."
