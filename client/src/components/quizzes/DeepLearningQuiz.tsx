        "It only works with numerical data",
        "It automatically learns hierarchical feature representations",
        "It requires less computational power",
        "It only works with supervised learning"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Deep learning's key distinction is its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of features through multiple layers, unlike traditional ML which often requires manual feature engineering."
    },
    {
      question: "In a neural network, what happens during the forward pass?",
      options: [
        "Weights are updated based on the error",
        "The loss function is minimized",
        "Input data is processed through the layers to generate predictions",
        "Gradients are calculated and propagated backwards"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "During the forward pass, input data flows through the network's layers, with each layer performing its computations to eventually produce output predictions."
    },
    {
      question: "What is backpropagation in deep learning?",
      options: [
        "A method to initialize network weights",
        "The process of adding more layers to the network",
        "A technique to compress the neural network",
        "An algorithm to calculate gradients and update weights"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Backpropagation is the algorithm used to calculate gradients of the error with respect to the network weights, allowing the network to learn by updating weights to minimize error."
    },
    {
      question: "Which type of layer is commonly used for image processing in deep learning?",
      options: [
        "Convolutional layers",
        "Recurrent layers",
        "Dense layers",
        "Normalization layers"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Convolutional layers are specifically designed for processing grid-like data such as images, as they can effectively detect spatial patterns and features."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of activation functions in neural networks?",
      options: [
        "To store network weights",
        "To introduce non-linearity and enable complex pattern learning",
        "To reduce the number of parameters",
        "To speed up training time"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn and model complex patterns and relationships in the data that wouldn't be possible with just linear transformations."
