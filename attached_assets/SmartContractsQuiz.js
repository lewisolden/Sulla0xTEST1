      question: "What is a key characteristic of smart contracts?",
      options: [
        "They require manual execution",
        "They are self-executing when conditions are met",
        "They can be modified after deployment",
        "They need intermediaries"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Smart contracts are self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code and execute automatically when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'Oracle Problem' in smart contracts?",
      options: [
        "Software bugs in the code",
        "High transaction fees",
        "Difficulty in getting reliable external data",
        "Slow execution speed"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The Oracle Problem refers to the challenge of getting reliable real-world data into blockchain smart contracts while maintaining decentralization and security."
    },
    {
      question: "Which platform was the first to implement smart contracts?",
      options: [
        "Bitcoin",
        "Ethereum",
        "Cardano",
        "Solana"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to implement smart contracts, using its Solidity programming language and becoming the foundation for many decentralized applications."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes smart contracts immutable?",
      options: [
        "Regular updates",
        "Code cannot be changed after deployment",
        "Administrative controls",
        "User permissions"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contract code cannot be changed. This immutability ensures contract terms remain constant and builds trust between parties."
    },
    {
      question: "Which is NOT a common use case for smart contracts?",
      options: [
        "Automated lending",
        "Supply chain tracking",
        "Personal messaging",
        "Insurance claims processing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Personal messaging is not a common use case for smart contracts, as they are primarily designed for automating business logic and transactions rather than communication functions."
