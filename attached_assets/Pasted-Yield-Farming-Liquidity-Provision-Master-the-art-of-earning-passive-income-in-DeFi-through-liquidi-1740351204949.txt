Yield Farming & Liquidity Provision
Master the art of earning passive income in DeFi through liquidity provision and yield optimization

What is Yield Farming?
Yield farming is like earning interest on your cryptocurrency assets, but with potentially higher returns than traditional banking. Instead of letting your crypto sit idle in a wallet, you put it to work in various DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols.

Think of it like being both a bank and an investor: You provide your crypto assets to help others trade (like a bank providing loans), and in return, you earn a portion of the fees plus additional reward tokens (like earning both interest and stock dividends).

Multiple Yields
Earn various forms of rewards simultaneously

Compound Growth
Reinvest earnings to accelerate returns

Dynamic APY
Yields vary based on market conditions

Understanding APR in Yield Farming
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) represents your yearly earnings from yield farming, expressed as a percentage of your initial investment.

📅
Monthly: ~$16.67
