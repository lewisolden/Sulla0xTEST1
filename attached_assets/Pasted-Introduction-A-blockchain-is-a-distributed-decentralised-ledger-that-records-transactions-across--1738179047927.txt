Introduction
 
A blockchain is a distributed, decentralised ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the integrity and security of the data. It's the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its potential applications extend far beyond digital currencies.
 
Key Characteristics of Blockchain
 
1. Distributed Ledger
   • Data is spread across multiple nodes (computers) in the network
   • Each node has a complete copy of the entire blockchain
 
2. Decentralisation
   • No single authority controls the blockchain
   • Consensus among network participants validates transactions
 
3. Immutability
   • Once data is recorded, it's extremely difficult to change or delete
   • Ensures data integrity and builds trust in the system
 
4. Transparency
   • All transactions are visible to all participants
   • Enhances accountability and reduces fraud
 
5. Security
   • Uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units
   • Resistant to tampering and fraud
 
Basic Structure of a Blockchain
 
1. Blocks
   • Contain a list of transactions and other key information
   • Include a timestamp and a unique identifier (hash)
 
2. Chain
   • Blocks are linked together in chronological order
   • Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a chain
 
3. Transactions
   • Represent the transfer of value or data within the network
   • Must be validated by the network before being added to a block
 
4. Nodes
   • Computers that participate in the blockchain network
   • Validate transactions and maintain the blockchain
 
How Blockchain Works
 
1. Transaction Initiation
   • A user initiates a transaction
 
2. Transaction Broadcast
   • The transaction is broadcast to all nodes in the network
 
3. Validation
   • Nodes validate the transaction based on the blockchain's rules
 
4. Block Creation
   • Validated transactions are combined into a block
 
5. Block Validation
   • The network reaches consensus on the validity of the new block
 
6. Block Addition
   • The new block is added to the existing blockchain
 
7. Transaction Completion
   • The transaction is now recorded and confirmed
 
Comparison with Traditional Databases
 
1. Centralization vs. Decentralisation
   • Traditional: Centrally controlled
   • Blockchain: Distributed control
 
2. Data Modification
   • Traditional: Can be easily modified
   • Blockchain: Extremely difficult to alter past records
 
3. Transparency
   • Traditional: Often limited visibility
   • Blockchain: Typically offers full transparency
 
4. Trust
   • Traditional: Requires trust in a central authority
   • Blockchain: Trust is distributed among network participants
 
Conclusion
 
Blockchain technology represents a paradigm shift in how we store, validate, and transfer data. Its unique properties of decentralisation, immutability, and transparency have the potential to revolutionise various industries beyond finance, including supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and more. Understanding the basics of blockchain is crucial for grasping the full potential of this transformative technology.
